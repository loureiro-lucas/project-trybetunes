# Project TrybeTunes! ðŸš€

In the third project of **React** module of Trybe course, my goal was to develop a website that user can listen to music previews provided by iTunes API. User can serach by artist, choose between albuns and save a favorites playlist, that is saved in `localstorage`.

I could practice my HTML, CSS, JavaScrip and React skills, specially `components lifecycle` and `react router features`.

`Mandatory Requirements:`

- 1 - Create the necessary routes for the application using `BrowserRouter`;

- 2 - Create a Login `form`, rendered on route `/`;

- 3 - Create a `Header` component, rendered on routes `/search`, `/album/:id`, `/favorites`, `/profile` and `/profile/edit`;

- 4 - Create navigation links inside the `header` component to search, favorites and profile pages;

- 5 - Create a `form` to search artists inside `Search` component, rendered on route `/Search`;

- 6 - Make the API request and list the returned albums. Each album must redirect to the route `/album/:id`;

- 7 - Create the music list for selected album inside the `Album` component, and render it on route `/album/:id`;

- 8 - Create inputs to add songs to favorites;

- 9 - Favorites songs must be tagged when entering an album;

- 10 - Refresh favorite musics playlist when a song is add to it;

- 11 - Add a feature to remove song from favorites;

`Bonus Requirements`

- 12 - Display the playlist of favorite songs in `Favorites` component, rendered on route `/favorites`;

- 13 - Create a user profile page in `Profile` component, rendered on route `/profile`;

- 14 - Create a `form` to edit the user profile.
